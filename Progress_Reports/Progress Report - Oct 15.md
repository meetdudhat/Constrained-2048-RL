### Ayman
* **Past Two Weeks:** Led the development of the core 2048 game environment in Python and set up the project's GitHub repository for version control.
* **Next Two Weeks:** Will participate in the team's upcoming planning session to help define the technical requirements for integrating an RL agent into the game environment.

---
### Meet
* **Past Two Weeks:** Collaborated on the design and logic for a baseline agent that interacts with the game environment by making random moves. 
* **Next Two Weeks:** Will contribute to the team's planning session by researching and discussing potential RL algorithms suitable for solving the 2048 problem.

### Sachin
* **Past Two Weeks:** Focused on the implementation of the baseline agent, ensuring it correctly performed valid moves until a terminal state was reached.
* **Next Two Weeks:** Will analyze the suitability of different RL model architectures during the team's planning session to help guide our implementation strategy.

---
### Jason
* **Past Two Weeks:** Designed a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify critical game functionalities such as score accumulation and valid move generation.
* **Next Two Weeks:** Will help define key performance indicators and success metrics for the RL agent during the team's planning session.

---
### Arya
* **Past Two Weeks:** Authored a series of test cases to ensure the game engine behaves as expected after each move, focusing on the integrity of the board state.
* **Next Two Weeks:** Will help establish the validation criteria and overall testing framework for the future RL agent during the team's planning session.

### Team Goals for Next Milestone
The primary objective for the entire team over the next few days is to collaborate on a detailed plan for the next milestone: deploying our first RL agent. Following this planning session, we will finalize and distribute the specific development tasks among all members.
