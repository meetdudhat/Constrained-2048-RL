### Team Goals for Next Milestone and Current Milestone Status

The team's primary focus for the past period was the Environment Demo (due Oct 27). All members successfully contributed their parts to the demo video.

Due to this focus and a concurrent 20% assignment, the team did not manage to complete the "First RL Agent" milestone (due Oct 30). This milestone is now the team's immediate priority for the next two-week period along with our future Nov 15 improvement milestone.
